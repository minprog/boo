# Complexity

In this assignment you'll learn all about efficient code and how to make your
own code more efficient. Specifically we'll introduce the big *O* notation,
which can be used to describe how efficient some piece of code is, and we'll
cover some Python data structures that'll help make your code more efficient.

These data structures, like dictionaries and sets, can be very useful when
writing code in general, but they really shine when making code more efficient.
To highlight this, we'll also show an example of how code can be made more
efficient using these structures.

For the assignment, you'll have to write an indexing system that can search
through book texts to find specific words. This program will have to search
through large collections of text fast, so it should also be *efficient*.
